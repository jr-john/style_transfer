<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> woman wants some challenge, not just a guy she can walk all over him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> is because nobody has done it to then so they dont know how it feels.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> to get over him just play with guys
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> “I know he’s a jerk but he says he wants to be with me.”

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it's easy to say yes, but i have a feeling it would be tough to do.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u don't need to worry about that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> There is no way that that's the problem.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> try a card if you cant just say i love you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> or that he would like to see you wear, and then go back and buy it.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Why should she miss anyone who in the first place wasnt hers?

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i think you got a boyfriend.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the one i had with your mom.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do any other girls feel the same..?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't you really mean, how many minutes into the first date????
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i like him but i don't know if he likes me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> sometimes it dosnt matter if you no how to use it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> what kind of friend are you looking for?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> how much does your balls sweat?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but lately he avoids me & wont even talk to me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dance for him with something sexy!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i like girls with nice personalities
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I like school teachers...but I'm not one.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but sometimes he acts like he still does.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> depends how far you would let me go...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he obviously is trying to hit another girl so i would back off.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And have a happy Valentines Day!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Always happy...waking up this morning...at work now.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Have I told... you lately that your cuuuuuuuuuuuutee!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> keep your head high and dont give up hope if things dont work out!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> There are some good country boys out there that would love to have a good country girl!!)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Ask her out on a casual date.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and DO NOT  encourage your girlfriend to become a stirpper.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because that description surely screams FLIRTING!!!!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yeah my boyriend is crazy abou my toes!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you love someone then you sacrifice being with other people.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Good luck and have a nice day!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> When I had sex with a guy who worked like a machine.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do he still like me r is he playing games
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you love someone it's because who the are not because the color of their skin
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> There isnt supposed to be any false love...so I guess true love is just a euphemism
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you only want your ex then leave the rest alone.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Theres no need to keep playin games.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ur probably so d*mn ugly he has no choice but to look.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just tlak to her ask her out to dinner or something like that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If she likes you - great.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just be like Hey Lets Kick It Some Time!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> First of all dont call then stupid and ugly because they like u.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Maybe he thinks its your fault that u have a baby.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You can't really tell that soon, I don't think.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If she is getting jealous then their must be a reason why.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He needs to see what it's like firsthand.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> find me for alot of fun!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no but he see u more bitful at night cuz ur father is sleeping lol
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I bet you are a beautiful person and should not be gealous of it...go out there and have fun!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't let these girls lie to you!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> a question that left you busting up laughing
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> YOU ARE TRUELY A SAD CASE!!!!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and you can even tell him why if he ask.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> What if the people were guys?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Girl, it's not going to last, go out and have fun!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no, don't ask him, instead push his buttons so that he asks you out.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe because you are differant than every one else!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> best way is LOOK STRAIGHT INTO HIS EYES and u will get the answer
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Besides... do we really want our moms to be liars?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> TELL HIM IN HIS LOVE LANGUAGE (WE ALL HAVE OURS)  Find out his love language and speak it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do you really want to spend the rest of you life with someone like that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Everytime I talk about it he says I am pushing him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i would think that he is having sex with someone eles.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> SOMETIMES I COME BACK TO MY HOMETOWN TO GET AWAY WHICH IS ACROSS COUNTRY TO WHERE HE IS.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> remember that this guy needs to help pay for your expenses, too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> lol   you juos laugh out loud and you should feel better
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He is a guy what do you expect
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> could be, it sounds like he like he likes being around you... you never know!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> y does the skin color matter??
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Get over yourself and go to that wedding!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> My e-mail is jakb6hsm@yahoo.com  I like new friends
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if a black man breaks into my house is it fair to say most black people are criminals!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't be a wimpy, winey, wuss.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I like the woman to be loud though!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he has money and isnt a kreep stay!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> cheat on you then write a note.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you ask him I dont think he would lie to you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Have a good life, don't let him way you down.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the guy you are talking to is a psychopath, a control freak.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So that next day I went with my boyfriend out to eat to the place we were going to.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But there is no guys in this town (worth dating)!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I want her, to want me....
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You shouldnt think that because then everyone will think u are stupid( like me.)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Did his boss give him a hard time...?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and she just has this constant fear.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Beautiful girls can be found everywhere, just look around you!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because distance makes lies harder to hide.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> here i expect he will go to jail even though you say it was mutual.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> by the way, all those commercials saying, condoms don't always protect, well, something is better than nothing!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if its a different one each week i doubt it... but check the signs: eye contack and flirting
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> should i break up with her or go with it and trust that she really loves me ?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dont ever go to places that u used to hang out.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> SHOULD I GO BACK OR STAY HOME?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But dont feel  bad or hurt if he tries to put you down,Life is long.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Yea u love him but u wanna risk him gettin sumthin an bringin it back ta u?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Most guys aren't really stupid, you're just meeting the wrong people.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I think its a big myth that guys are just big, retarded sex fiends.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> EVEN THOUGH IT'S OKAY, YOUR PARTNER NEED NOT KNOW EVERYTHING YOU THINK ABOUT.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Unless it was a good dream, of course.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he want to just be friends , it's best to move on.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> WHAT COMES AORUND GOES AROUND SWEETHEART.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Depends on the man OF COURSE!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it's very easy just buy him a flower and say that you love him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Say Adios to her, life is waaaayyyyy too short!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u know we do it too!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> The boy is 14-16 years old and he likes me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But if you decide to go for it....HAVE FUN!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> theres not much you can do if a guy does not want a relationship w you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do things that makes you happy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It depends on the girl i guess, but i lie all the time and people really buy it :)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the best town is ur imagination because if thats all you want you will never get anything
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its not good to date them all
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Ever heard of a pajama party????
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Guys do like it when girls can spell (or at least aren't too lazy to look words up).
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> riza if you dont know why, then why answer for all you know its some creep
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I've been there it the place is really great...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> As for the guy just try to ignore him and eventually it will be forgotten!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but to answer your question no there is no way to understand men.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just wanting to meet friends in Amsterdam
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she act like she doesnt like so what should i do date here or leave her alone
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you try to take it slow, no guy like to hear that he is a bad kisser.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> That is like asking if love ever existed... Not everyone is bad.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> !are you some kind of schizoprinia?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> what do you like bieng asked?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do crazy stuff like cover yourselves in whipped cream or something tasty.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dont jsut wait for something good to happen.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> like he is really cute then what do you do then
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> threaten him by saing ur going to call the police if he doesnt pay child support!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> even if they laugh at the time.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm not sure what to do
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> first and formost, for him just to say so shows the kind of man he really is.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if its because you like someone else- say that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they are unwise and mean and they are gonna have to learn the hard way.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> makes 4 quick access i guess?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He got waaaay too many girl friends help me im confused!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i say right on to being a virgin it is a really big sin to not be a virgin.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you can stop trying to control her life?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> why would a guy want to go out with an frigid ice princess such as yourself.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i'm just trying to avoid any quarrels... she gets jealous pretty easily!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Some men are scared of marige, and stuff so a good talk might help!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So men, why would you or wouldnt you date a virgin?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Because when they think their head hurts because they have no brain!And   boys are just  boys!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Why so many men dream about living with an asian girl.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But i guess it really depends on if you want an emotinal attatchment.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> close your eyes and do your thing
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Once a cheat, always a cheat...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> talk to me-- you can't be that lonely !!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Anger makes you say YOU CAN'T HURT ME ANYMORE!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Because, in all honesty, that is SO sexy just in itself.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> get with somone more in tune with your maturity level
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I would not be attracted to her in the first place
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its healthy and natural,but if you dont becareful you can get some nasty viruses!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And take a good look in the mirror.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he got what he wanted... he is done with you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> most guys, as you probably know, are horny all of the time.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I would also question how much of a friend is your best friend??????
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you're considering taking him back DON'T.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Send him a message from ur mobile!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> god moves in many ways ?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> when u r at least 16
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He loves you for being HIS only!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> omg i had the same problem look at the awnsers i got.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And your time and YOUR life!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he'll understand and think nothing of it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Hope that helps (if even a little).
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Please try to remember this: The leading cause of DIVORCE is GETTING MARRIED!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he is unwilling to lick it then don't let him stick it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i wish then you would have no problem getin laid(@)(@)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yeah... i did that and it SUCKED!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You just cannot force yourself on anyone or you will not have anyone.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you are not growing and having fun, then the relationship is DEAD.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I also have that problem but if your nice in bed, I'm pretty sure she won't even notice.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> get her things that actually mean something.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Depends on how old are you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Having younger friends will help make up think & feel younger =)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> say back off bitch i hate u
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I don't think the hubby desearved to have it!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you get in life what you pay for.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Yeah its possible...it happens a lot to me
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No, I'm a girl, I only think about sex if I'm realy in love of some guy
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he's cheating then kick him to the curb.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And think of this if you think of NOTHING else...S-T-D's he may bring one home to you!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no there is no way that girls will EVER understand guys.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Party it up while your young.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i heard your geting married, when it is ?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Try some honesty, it works for me
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Him asking you out is up to him, you blew it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but i absolutely love italian women!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> still trying to figure that one out myself
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If she's really, really ugly, then yes - not having sex is very beneficial.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> why their more exciting sports are the ones with a lot of contact?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> once you have moved on then you wont care if he moves on or not.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> first of all, that's not typical of a guy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but most woman talk about it for sure, there are noveltie parties with sex toys.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> except that didn't end too great... :(
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> think about it before that way you wont get tunge tied
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do it when you are married
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she does it again, shame on you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> okay so about 3 months ago this all started with flirting.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> go out with ur ld friends to meet other new friends.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He will accidently run into u out & about.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if she is aromantic, get her some flowers and chocolate eventhough valentines day is over.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I don't know about you but I don't like the bad boy type.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> (sung as off key as possible)  silly songs are the way to go!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Maybe even try to hook him up with a friend!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I found someone at a strip club whom I married.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but I may whant it more then guys.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they actually have younger brains than we do.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> him nd i met through a friend(his bro.)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you should think it through very good.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Yes there are, I am not one of them.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hello how are you?what you neam?i just want friend in  amsterdam please send to me sincarely shaba
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm not a prude at all, i love oral sex, porn, i'm good looking.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just like most of the time guys dont understand girls.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Your bestfriend is not a friend if he had sex with your girl.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i dunno.. maybe i'm just not born 2 lie 2 much.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> The least she could say is no.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I think about sex non-stop, and even more than all of my guy friends.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it feels bad and sad ok bye
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> is sad how some people are..
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> listen to the song baby baby stay gone by jimmy wayne.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I dont even talk to other guys.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If that doesnt work I dont know what to tell you because it works for me sometimes
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If she already has a guy then you just have to set your sights elsewhere.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You back up everything you say to her it's pretty simple
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if it doesnt fit in the mouth
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ask him if he likes your kids if he dont thin brack up beceas family comes 1st.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> U can tell by the way they look at u and the way the person talks 2 u
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i have been to a few.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Not all gals, but some do.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i would stop calling and see if he misses you and calls you!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ur future is not bright it;ll leads u to death.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> What are indications of a man flirting?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> WHY SHOULD U KILL THAT INNOCENT BABy
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> your guess is as good as mine.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well mine is 8 to 9 inchs
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Remember bill gates was probably dateless and considered ugly and stupid and look at him now.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> strike 1, he no like kids.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Best friends always come before girls.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> A girl who loves him and cares about him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> don't run he is just talking.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> keep that, you may find he is a really cool guy and want to stay friends
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If this guy says no he won't help.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ignore it when people start rumors.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you find out how let me know.GOOD LUCK
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No,  I am not soft, just trying to be fair.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dude, I hate to say it but she was cheating on you with this guy before you broke up.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i invited her over and we went inside my room and i shut the door lol.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Theres this hella hot guy in my neighberhood.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i am a gemini actually but honestly spiking i dnt bliv in horoscopes.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it's the only thing real serious ladies are serious about.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> instead of a girl u should get a guy for your own likings
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But i enjoy necking and even a little caressing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And I don't really think too much about it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't say to much stuff.Say hi!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hold your head up and smile.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> All I can say is Don't Look Back.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> is it ok for me to have sex with my gf?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you have a baby then the baby has a daddy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i went to clubs and that was just for a fun night.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So thats ur answer yes they say that wont cheat....
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> would have sex with more than one guy at once?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> personally i dont think that that is useful.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> what if you're interested in a lady, but not sure if she is in you?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> when your boyfriend dose not im u or call u for 3 weeks what would u do
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but if you have to ask you are probably too young or immature to really get married.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes because almost all men are like that
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Its all up to you.Just dont look too hard.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it does not mean good things for you as far as dating her goes.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> My guy friends all say confidnece (not arrogance though) is sexy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well, emmm... maybe you can call her or work really hard to earn some money and buy a car??
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sleep with his brother, or best friend.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Or you could spred rumors about her where ever you are.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't send an IM that says ASL?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> im telling you this from personal experience.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but woman do talk about it alot!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she did it once, shame on her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it can even help your relationship
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> SO SPILL THE BEANS AND LET IT FALL WHERE IT LANDS.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i saw them last year they were great etc
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do you really want someone that doesn't know what he wants?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Let her try on a sports bra.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell her that you love her and try to find money,,,,,,
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> (you all know you were thinking it!!)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I don't know you to love you!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> stop having sex with him which you should not be doing in the first place....
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you get bored easily when with him/her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You know your man, if you trust him don't worry.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You know what you should do.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ask him about it, if he denies it, and u no he is cheating, dump him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he/she really made u happy u would be glad to sayback off not flirt.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Oh, and as good as it may sound, dont do anything for Valentines Day!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the gay guys love listening to them.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he did call it was atleast once a week.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> most guys arent stupid, u just associate with the stupid ones
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I would say that is not okay because just because hes a guy doesnt mean that its right!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> My wife said it just depends on her mood at the time
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Well if u are really lookin for advice... Don't do it...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> First of all don't do anything that you don't want to.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Is it coz he doesnt trust me?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> YOU ARE YOUNG ....YOU NEED TO TALK TO YOUR MOM ABOUT THAT...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sorry its always gona be aucword and kinda weiro ish.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i just want some good love songs to listen to i know it's kind of sappy but whatever
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Divorce is not something that kids like.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell her there's something you've been wanting to tell her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I can't believe he is telling you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I believe being with someone is the best!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and this is the first time I ever had to do anything like this for anyone..PLEASE HELP ME!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Keep it that way no matter how mad she gets.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> that's a stupid question to ask, if you don't know you never will.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i dont live there so couldnt tell ya sorry
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ask her why she in the relationship and how she feel about you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I like it from the back!!!!!!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they like it up on top or bent over bow-wow style!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> follow ur heart...wat feels rite 2 u?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't let some other girl get a chance with your crush.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> love without sex and sex after marriage is best
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If I can't stop thinking about the guy I like, I just focus hard on my work or read.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> good question i'm a girl so us girls  will never know!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> that has 2 be the worst thing to do to your friend roght now!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you dont like him, you like his friend,why not tell him?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Hope you get some new friens soon...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> unfortunately if you have to ask, probably.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> are u wanting to get married?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sex is Like Air & Water.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't give him too many chances.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well... if you like her guess it is ok.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I know he loves me even more because I was still a virgin on our wedding night!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But I would not agree that girls should attack first!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Depends on if you are a girl too or not.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> As a guy, I know that many...no....the majority of guys are in relationships for there own personal gain..
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> try this, did this person have sex with their spouse before they got married?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> is that a question for a guy?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Try looking someplace besides the losers section.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> give him a chance and some time to get to know your children.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well it depends..   how old r u & how old is ur mom???
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you are even asking this question, i think you are probably too young to be getting married.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> wait and see what she has to say.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ease into it, don't just jump on him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It is called, He's just not that into you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I can tell ya one thing if you cheated on her Goddess help you soul!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you have to be confident flirt with us a lil but be sweet too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> don't have sex w/ him and see what he does...haha great advice i know!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but i really really like him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if u agree with him no prob but wot do u feel?

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he did, he wouldn't cheat.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but we never got together, because i was with his best friend *matt.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> As long as he really doesnt know the chicks it wont matter...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And you should be very respectable about it to.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but this girl i really do love.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> As long as she isn't thier boss.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> A not circumcised penis is pretty nasty!!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> from my on experince it depend's on the both of you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ....if she doesn't like you enough to remain only with you, it's not worth it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i'm 13 years old and 5'10.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> have a fun and interessing honeymoon!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> my bf notices so many girls when hes driving and he tries not to make it obvious.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I hate those kind so remember money can buy lots of things apart from class, style and grace
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> DONT TAKE ACTION, CUZ SHE'LLGET HERS EVENTUALLY.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Oh, and if guys knew u said that nobody would like u, just so u know.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> life is like that, everyone hurting each other.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I lost my virginity at the age of 17, I honestly didn't know what the hype was all about.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just ask him if he would mind if you sent such pics.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no but you should take care of it before you try to get preganant
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he says its nothing, tell him you're not stupid.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Did you not say for better or worse.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Anytime he says Come here  , there you go right behind him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> To my Bestsest friend (x infinity 2) your friend forever I LIKE CEREAL ^-^
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> A BABY CAN'T DECIDE IF IT WANTS TO LIVE OR DIE.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It makes me feel good about myself when other guys hit on me and flirt with me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> One said, I can't leave my kids, the other said, why do you want to have coffee with me!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> where is he working.. how many hours... ask him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> 18 i think no need to rush though.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Some guys really dont like any playing with their bums.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Women are a mystery, and we like it that way!!!!!!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> however i really do love her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i don't think he doesn't trust you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I like this one guy who used 2 be in my class.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I just like to get some advice.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Isn't it torture for one and ego for the other ...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell them you love them, and see if they tell you back
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> that's who we r it's in r blood and there is nothing u can do
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Im soooooooooooo loud we got complaints from our neighbors... no joke
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well one day i sat him down and told him i liked him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Be blunt... Hey, you guys going to let me in on the conversation or what?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he will defnetly get it at one point
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if this boy like you you should go with him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> pick me but be a little more specific on type or stereo i mean age counts too!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no one can control their dream.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Haven't you seen the Paris Hilton video YET?!!?!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Trust me, guys don't know what's best for a girl.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Go out with one of his friends and see how he takes it...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she says that it doesnt mean anything and that is every guy's dream.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Or hang out with best buddies, take your mind off of him, have fun, girl.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i cant answer that coz i havent experienced it..  but i think its possible
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I think she just wants to come to America like everyone else...but thats just me...peaceout !
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He probably thinks it's a good thing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the admiration s not enough reason to kiss
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and crying is ok....but talking is more productive.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Knocked up girls lose intrest that way.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> talk to the guy and figure out wut made him act like such a jerk
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Would I date a stripper, probably not.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you no longer want to see his/her face.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He didn't care if he knew!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> some guy was following me in a store and said i never liked levi's jeans until now, i ran.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they used to be best friends, but now they arent.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I want to be myself but not scare her away, what should i do?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it sounds like you're more hung up on virginity than most guys would be.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just tell him without having sex with him and you won't come over being cheap!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she never got over you the first time...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> y do u marry him when he's quiet and noe u want him to talk to u?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Be young - have fun... Don't take life so seriously.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> sorry but no, get a job
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No if your over 40 you might as well be 80
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i dont like to hurt anyone.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no, he just likes to talk to you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Your 3 year already has a daddy
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> All i really want is my ex to realize that i only want him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Find some Barry White stuff, it works.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you could find the most beatiful natural blonde and tall girl in this world but she wouldn't be smart!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Looking back, I am not really sure why I did it!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe cause u sound so sorry
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> be honest... ask him what he thinks... its a good way to start dont you think?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i kind of ruined jons friendship with matt.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It probably wasn't the brightest thing for him to tell you, but I wouldn't worry about it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i like this one guy *jon & he used to like me too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and to top it all off, i didn't get to come, cuz that headboard thing lost the whole mood.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'd give you 100pts for that one!!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they have lots of great suggestions on there.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> start talking about kids around your parents
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Um...I didn't...I let the man come to me and ask me out!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I found out my gf was really a boy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she knows she has to move on but she can't....any ideas that might help her out?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you just answered your own question.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> CAUSE THEY THINK THERYRE POPULAR AND HOTT AND THEY JUST ARE WHEN IT COMES TO DATING
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> for the majority it is quiet unless it is super goooooooooooood then i will be loud
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> some are 'snugglers', some are not.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't be dumb like I have been.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But I'm not the one who did anything wrong.I love him so much what should I do?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and i say this because its true.....Its not the only thing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> jon & i used to be really close & talk all the time about anything & everything.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> or he tells you he doesn't wanto do it rigth now?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Then i started smoking and drnking.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Why waste your time on someone that would disrespect you in that way?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> IF GURLS DONT LIKE U FOR THAT they HAVE PROBLEMS
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> can't he get a girl to share hers with him?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> my advise: dont go out with a stranger.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Be honest ....with him, and yourself,do you really want him back?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> go to iraq and keep in touch.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> at times i think only sex.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> when a girl likes u, u should be able to kno HELP ME GIRLS!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> They Just want to be loved
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> a compromise position is to refuse to hang out with her when she's been drinking.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But he tells me that they dont mean anything to him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> MOVE ON girl@ go have fun!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I think you just lust for him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Also tell him you had a bad experience with another guy that tried some stuff and made you mad.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No, seriously..  DON'T get him another dog!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> for me a girl beein mature!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Was I not attractive to him that night?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he doesn't love you, break up with him and don't even listen to his excuses!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i'd work with him some more.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Believe me, sweetheart, people are not always who they first appear to be.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you cant stop it..its like a reflex and we are just prone to do it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I for one dislike fake boobs.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> that's how life works... there will always be ups and downs in your life... just accept it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STAND.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But your bf isn't you bf.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Can I get custody even though he has been a stay at home dad?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> men want ladies out in public, and sluts at home in the bedroom.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Give him a bl*w job once in a while.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Maybe a hot bath for both of you!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Go intoroduce yourself, smile, be nice to her...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> are u matuer enough to handle a serious relationship?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> when women get togeather thats one of the main toppics.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because we make them nervous and their brains jus go out the window!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> BECUASE THEY USUALLY JUST LIKE TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and they are more romantic.. that what i think..

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Theres a reason why dis happened So jus be patient...evry cloud has a silver lining *Hugs*
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Remember, just because a guy knows your involved, doesnt mean he wont try anyway.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> most will if they get the chance but your not married so .............its about 99% i think
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i agree with rockhead  don't tell anyone
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you should have sex when you're horny.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you get even by becoming a better person then you were before you met her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> 2. my 1st time (& last) time having sex while watching telivision.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u cant get married in jail
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> why don't you just email him your question?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because most of them are horny assholes that can't get any.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> LOOK AROUND YOU EVERYONE IS BEAUTIFUL
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> see how it goes from there

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i dunno..i just know that i just gained 2pts.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dump him, just because you love him ...doesn't mean he love you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because pain is pleaser, & when one bleeds it's like an orgasm!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no, but that is because guys have different horomones than girls do.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ha ha that stuff is all true thats how i get sometimes...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I wouldn't take it that seriously, it's only a dream.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> That means you can have your cake and eat it too!!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it's time to move on...maybe it hurts but that's life.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dont hurt him but dont hurt yourself either...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it's just the way of life
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> We're not talking about flirting as in playing dumb.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> when my girlfriend bit my cock off and ate it
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you tend to love the person more when you have sex
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> SO theres a lot more out there then what is happening right now.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u can hold a 12hr coversation witha boy just talking about himself.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> 1. marriage is not a joke!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you like him go out with him why the hek do you have to ask  here?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i never thought i would get asked out but i did.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If i like a guy i ask him out before another girl out him out.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hahahaha yeaah right like I am going to post that kind of personal info
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sounds like a break up to me........
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> MY BOYFRIEND OF ALITTLE OVER A YEAR NOW HAS CONTINUED TO LIE TO ME THROUGHOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its the same reason mine is.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yup..as long as he love you den its not a problem anymore..loves doent mean money..dun judge it by money
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she will always be there 4 you ,care about you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I fell to my knees, I won't ever forget that weird moment.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but she doesnt trust me cause ive said similar things to both of them.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I garantee that all the girls that think they think about sex a lot have no effin idea.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just be original.That's all you gotta do.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if your in a relationship with one, you better think it over  if she is worth all the pain.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Why don't you get a job, and then you'll have money of your own.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because they are to in love and they think that theres hope
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> oooh....thats a tough one....just go out with her friend then shell want you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Is sex soooooo good that people are willing to risk so much??
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Best revenge: move on with your life and forget that the cheater ever existed.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It's like your happy most of the time and you're always glowing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> (careful if hes a non-understanding homosapien)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> becaue my train of thought ran off the track and bumped all other men's off to
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> YOU CANT AND I WOULD BE DISRESPECTFUL TO THE MINISTER
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if it hurts, and the woman can't take it, it's way to long.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I think it's time to for you to move on...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> got a good cast iron skillet?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Any man who doesnt like kids is  a coward to responsibility !!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dat was bad....... never again TV will be on during Sex.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell her if she loved you she would come over and fuck your brains out and swallow your kids
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you can't take it to be his friend then leave him alone
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you feel the best feeling uve ever felt in your whole life
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but only when theyare in the mood or if you spice the moment.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and what does it stands for?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you can (and its about love), its probably good.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> not all guys it depends on the guy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes it is but are you in love?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because red is blody color but we sey blue is LOVE
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they end up thinking you`re a total bastard.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> As long as that person  says it's OK.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> especially if your used to having sex on a regular basis.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Or maybe someone is trying to break you guys apart.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Having sex with a guy who was toooooo smallllll!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> what's so shameful sex is freakin' awesome!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I cant stop thinking about him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> OLD man says:hey baby,wanna see me change my teeth.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> that's more exciting u know.shyness sucks.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't spend a lot of money.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I wouldnt dump my girl over those I have gotten nude pics from.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just look at her eyes and smile.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> couldn't have been bad if they married anyway.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> friend, spouse, or even your family members.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u better leave his a$$ u can do bad all by yoself!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but, to make this person stay with u is a dificult part.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if ur in bangalore i am here :)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he lies to me and hangs up in my face.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I don't think it's a sin, but it surely ends in fornication!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> lol... well, I think that being on that beach next to the fire with spotter888 sounds pretty darn good!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you are going to find someone else and wonder why you forgave this guy so many times!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Depends if you believe in books about what dreams mean I guess...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Takes a lot of patience, I bet.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> What in the HELL should I say??
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But, we are happy and enjoy life!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You marry becasue you want to spend the rest of your life with the man!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> HE ALWAYS SAYS SORRY..BUT THEN A MONTH LATER HES LYING AND BEING DISHONEST.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I start quiet and get louder and louder and then....BAAAAMMMM!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I can't help thinking, was it me?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Not all guys care only about sex.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Prob his way of good time is sex.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you like a man talk to him and get to know him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It really depends how ugly she is.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> so just make sure she knows how much you love her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> DO NOT TELL HIM FACE TO FACE, IT MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD AT ONE TIME IT WONT BE NOW.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well then recognize what you dont want to
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> O and trust me IT CAN GET BAD!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> guys r not scared of the word love.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> nope.. maybe he wants 2 hear ur voice b4 he tucks himself 2 bed.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Would u make out with him, even if u werent officially going out.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> your wrong on that one personal issues huh?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> When you cant get that person off your mind
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i would ask her if it was urs
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> How could anyone not like kids ???
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> twice first one i met and wanted to marry right then, the second is still unravelling.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I told him how do you know I'm looking at you ????
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and their friends will bad talk you to theirs and so on and so on
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Asking this cuz is like it is always guys that is ready and up for sex..
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Never let anyone tell you different
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Jealousy is a heck of a demon to fight.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> - Dress up & act ladylike.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> as soon as they get mad beacause you wont have sex with them, dump them.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If that doesn't do it, then I'm stumped.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I don't like the way they cus.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes ya not and now that person seem to be a good frined
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> FIRST OF ALL THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT AGE MATCH THE DESIRES DIFFER...SO BE CAREFUL
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> The rest is just window dressing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> jus tell her how you feel and why you love her
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well he wont be married much longer.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i mean beauty is skin deep!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u r not considered unless u do it back in return.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> She was kind of this outcast punk rocker chich with big blue eyes.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sending money is NOT better, your kid wants YOU there!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Have you ever heard of descriminating based on sexual orientation...and how that is WRONG???
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I actually prefer Hispanic men above all!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If I do then why would I be snooping around In his stuff?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> not love, but who knows right?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but definately force her because no bra is very unattractive.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Probably the flirting led you to beleive he DID want more?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if that doesn't work tell him that you have an STD.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> She is nothing special to others, but she is my true LOVE... That's all !!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> In places where there are black men...duh!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hell NO,  u must be smart
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if youre talkin about here, the internet, that is a wrong place.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ive actually heard alot of guys say that thye prefer virgins.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> oh not to mention a cute A$$ and small boobies ( ya as weird as it is!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because they are an orgasm addict
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If the guy doesn't like her, then advice to move on.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Obviously you decided you don't want to sleep with him or you would have already.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If so how many years have you been married?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> try yes if u like him and no if u dont!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> trust ur humor, beauty, intelligence, relation with other, how u conenct... and the like.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you are doing the right thing just devorce him, and get back to your life.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Stop thinking about what could be and dreaming.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he realy loves you than he wouldnt care if you have nothing to offer.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Some places to go to: beaches, restaurants,...etc.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes tell him the worst he will do is say no
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hay just be friends with him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> After I busted him cheating of course.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well try kissing him...are there any sparks?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yeah but you get more horny than fall in love
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Games, games games, don't play them, you always loose.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> To each their own BUT I'll still be eating my chocolates and enjoying my roses while you...........?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just remember a man is stll a man.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So......you wanta have sex or not?!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> 1ST OF ALL YOU CAN'T HELP WHAT YOU DREAM ABOUT, AND 2ND FANTASIZING IS JUST THAT, A FANTASY.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If my sister's friend shit on ME I would leave the room immediately!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But i will expect her to do the same..So just get with better guys....
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he gets the point, then stick it out...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and when she does, all she dreams about is him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dont compromise your salvation for anyone.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes, I guess I like the thugish type of guys.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i was 15 that was 9 months ago an im still with her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do you think she'll know that you like her without telling her?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just don't tell her you love her too early.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they can never be what you are.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I care about him a lot, and I miss him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u broke up leave it 2 him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i noticed you like goo goo dolls have you ever seen then in concert.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe she's not a material kind of girl.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> There really is no way to answer that without sounding like a racist of which I am not.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its basically deciding who i want to marry.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just remember its up to you if u dont want to u dont have to!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Later on that month things started changing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> REally tell her to think twice.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> How about a nice homemade personalised gift!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Then it is up to her to listen or not and find out in the hard way or not
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> there not the kind of guy you want.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Have you ever had a fallout like that?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you dont even know how old he is???
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> as little as possible forgive and forget
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> older as in 3 - 5 yrs so he's alot matured
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> at least you can trust us cause even if we lie you'd know!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> movies are fun, but it doesnt provide much bonding.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she tried to use the credit cards and learned they did not work.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i can tell u that all girl think different.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dreams are just that dreams and it is our brain working things out.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But be extra careful, you're playing with fire!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Knock that bastard upside his head.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You might not like it but pretend to.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> marriage is better, no one said that it was going to be easy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if not someone will find u
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> how old r u well that doesn't even matter run
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm just not attracted you anymore.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If I did, yahoo answers would not be where I would look!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you try it once...its menas you tried it once.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If my hubby cheated, I'd probably chop his thing off and hang it from the mustang's rearview mirror...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I get hungry twice a day.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I laughed my ass off when i read it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I luv talking to him, it's like I don't feel real good unless I talk to him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> friends are hard to come by..
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> mr nobody get drunk and kiss her that is how i did it three year ago.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If the boy has such an attitude of mind he's not worth ur love even if u r simple.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> so thats why i went with matt.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> My yahoo chat name used to be 'iscreamifyoudoitright'
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just ask her she'll probably like you to have some help
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> SHE OR HE WILL GET IT.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> My wife gave me a kiss and took off with the kids.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> undress yourself infront of him u will know
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> then, i learned that he likes me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I am cause if i wasnt then i'd be w. a girl lol!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he has friends though then maybe he likes you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Why in the world WOULDN'T a guy date a virgin?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Who here has married their high school sweetheart?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Did u watch movie The Game?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> leave him alone he got what he wanted and maybe don't want to talk to you anymore
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> LEAVE HIM ALONE OR YOU MIGHT BE RUNNING INTO TROUBLE.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I have gotten dates, not as many as if I played stupid.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i bet you'll fall for me once you see me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But you're probably too good for her anyway.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And if not the pet store... just look around the barns.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u dont just lose the bi**h cuz she will stay to hurt u and love doing it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it's very easy....just tell him... talk to me or get out of my life thats all honeybun
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just say  I love me too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its not so good for the person who has the available booty.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Well obviously if she won't tell you she doesn't want you to know.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i asked him if he still liked me & he said no.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and look at pictures of guys.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do whats right and listen to your heart!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Why don't you have a job?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just be a cool guy, don`t take girls for granted.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you're a fucking retard and if you were my kid you wouldn't be allowed to date.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> She is using you to get over here!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u need to talk to him about it and tell him to stop
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i need to know if its alright
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> have sex right before you go to bed
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he speaks about it then listen to him and show that u care.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't even do that to yourself!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> same reason why men do it!~ ^_^
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dude you forget about that you move on you find someone who loves you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> a boyfriend thats his friend to.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he is cute to u and got a nice personality then say yeah duhhhhh!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he likes you, tell him you love him... it gets things moving, worked like a charm for me!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you are a boy then sure!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I am scared to ask him if he stills likes me, because I liked him too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Ask her permission if in doubt!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> in no way do you need him or anyone bring you down.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I couldn't hurt someone I cared about that way.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Have u cheated on her in the past?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i cant stand a woman like that.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> THIS IS THE PROBLEM IN AMERICA!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> either you get along with this person or you do not.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dunno, cook him dinner, show him u care.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> we think we are giving them signals but they dont get it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ALTHOUGH I'M SURE IF THEY COULD WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE DECISSION WOULD BE.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe you should not be worried at all.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> kiss her on the cheek first and if she knows what u mean shell carry on from there.. ;)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> my husband and i moved in after 2 weeks go 4 it
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Ain't the size kiddo, it's how u use it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i think everybody has a right to enjoy my girlfriend doin stripping..  U r welcome to the party too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> 1.when you hear that love song and all you think about is them.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but do you love somebody ?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but even if, she's still ur friend.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i know alot just email me and i will tell you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dont try to impress her at all.Just let her know that you like her
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do u have Irish in you?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe that is why it is called fantazys
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Some learn it and do well, others do not.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but they dont have to be half naked.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So if you find the answer let me know.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I wanna do things to you I wouldn't even do to an oreo.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I am really mature so don't mess with me!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't just go to him and say hey I wanna bone your sister really bad.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Until then, quit being such a jerk.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you really like him you will just know.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> not a bad person at ALL!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I doesnt matter if u do it right!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> be nice and relaxed and let her know that you like her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> People don't do things they don't get something out of.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I BELIEVE A WOMAN SHOULD MAKE HER OWN DECISSION.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You should call him and ask him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I am a 20 yo female.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> people have lots of reasons why  they have not found that right person.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You can still be friends...hell even friends with benefits.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And you really want him to ask you to marry him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> look forget the fu?k and go out with me!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And just do it, if yo wait you will never get anywhere.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> look you just have to be normal.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Every once in a while, I won't, just for a change.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> start looking for someone  more compatable and closer your age
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Have I told... you lately... that I lub you...?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Well it cna mean many differnt things.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I say, Look what you wearing.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> That you aint getting none homie
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Next, you should totally focus on getting to Level 3, real fast, okay ?!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> SHE SHOULD DECIDE TO PREVENT GETTING PREGNANT.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no, coming from a girl, i dont think about sex as much as my ex boyfriend did.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I don't like a big cry baby though!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Why would you want to marry someone that is in jail for one..????
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> we have flurted may times but i just don't know *_*
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it is not men ,it is the boy you went out with.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but i took an instant dislike for him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Then of course there are many questions on wheather i've been f---ked up the a--.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just speak with your eyes baby!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Women want it slow......and take too long for it......men want it without a tease.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and we sat on my bed and looked in her eyes and huged her and kissed/made out with her
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Why get married.... just become some ones Biotch
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u've gotta accept the sad truth.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> don't you love your xgf at all?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> so it's either get over him, or wait.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> beside now this days its hard to find a virgin!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> REPEAT AFTER ME....YOU ARE A LYING DIRT FACE!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> -im just wondering-      -thanks for answering-
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Go hang around with some really rough men, you know, a ' man's man'
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i care for him a lot, but only as a friend.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm a self-proclaimed nympho, but I dunno if I'm just really nasty or really horny... all the time.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> She might come clean to u if she doesn't want to be with u anymore.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Honey, if you don't want to have sex with a guy, that's o.k.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> First, Who broke up with who?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dress like a decent lady and you will find nicer guys.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'll try anything once and again if I like it
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> as long as there is no physical activity, I don't see why not
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i don't know are u ready for one?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> jon told me to stay with matt.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he will b pleasently suprised and will luv all the more for it:)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> & i told him yes very.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> cheat on her with one of her friends and treat her friend better than u treated her
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you're not planning to marry him, why bother?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the problem is that the girls that do smell.. think they don't.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Most guys care about that, some don’t, it’s up to the guy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell him to go to hell!!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Get yourself some self esteem and dump his ass.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its probably that woman don't like wussies!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But yeah, guys do think about sex more than girls.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> mayb its cuz ur doin something wrong!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> older doesnt mean that his foot is in d grave.. lol.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> are there reasons you do not trust him?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Hand the mofo a toilet brush.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hit me up if u want more... digital_lyricist at yahoo dot com.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you want to get married then do so.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> astrology is a bunch of bunk.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Men are beautiful no matter what.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Ask him straight up, if he wants to marry you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> BUT TO MUCH OF A GOOD THING CAN TURN IN TO A BOTHER.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> cuz they have a one track mind
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He doesn't like your kids, you don't like his?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Have your fun now when you are single.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because its called lust, which is a sin.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I guess I just have some anxiety about it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but my new girl really means a lot to me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> make sure it's a good, clean fun.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Now you get two of everything.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> theres a mr right for every girl.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Go to movies, sight seeings etc.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well now, that kind of difficult.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> What you need to do is get MAD!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe she wants to have sex but not with u.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> where do u get these stats?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you connect with someone, just don't worry about other people's feeling's...   Dr Checko...   (Nickname)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I love having phone sex w/my bf.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just tell him to his face in a nice way, that its over.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Its easy Find someone to marry you in the Jail
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> What if some guy would ask, why are all woman s1uts?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she might do it agin oh and thanks i'll let him know.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't let anybody ever tell you different.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Oh, and if the guy is to marry the girl, she can't have slept with too many other guys.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I am an old fashioned kind of guy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you are with an unsaved (sinner) you are a sinner too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no phisical contact, no eyes contact, no hand contact, just the faith that the other one says the truth...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe she also got the same feeling as u are..............
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> good looks,good habbits & ofcourse a great figure makes a girl a good girlfrind
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Why not get a job and send him money?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Give her something really nice and then ask right there on the spot.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> then she will think you are really hiding something.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Stop thinking about looks and start looking at people on how they treat u
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> can any1 here speak clear english?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It's about the one you're with.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Who could say no to that?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Repeat after me IT'S NOT MY FAULT!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I got 2: u judge for yrself.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> She asked me about my feelings...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> my old man don't he just go right to it and get in it
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> then one day he started flirting with me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> only if u feel like u need a boyfriend.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no because the same thing happened to me  but it might be different
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Would it bother him if you did were asking guys for pictures?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u r jus experiencing new things which is a gud thing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If not it wasn't meant to be.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and if he likes you for your activities, start doing things that he wouldn't like.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> start talking about marriage ands kids and his family that might spook him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> flowers,  not roses that might be too strong.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> YOu don't have to run but you might want to tell him to slow down!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> when me & matt first got together i really liked jon, & i didnt know he liked me too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hmm, I would hide their lunch box and not play with them at recess!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> NO, I THINK YOU CANT SPELL.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you most likely can do alot better.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> That would be NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS !
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and it makes ppl more anxious and jealous, so beware of that too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM SO MANY TIMES JUST STICK WITH BOTH OF THEM BUT JUST PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGTHT!!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> IT MAY TO LATE TO ATTEMPT ABORT.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So I will tell you what alot of the guys I know dream of.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he treated her right then i see nothing wrong with it its not like she is your sis
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Boys love themselves its sick man.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if she likes you then she should know that your new at it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it depends on u. but would u want to?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but it jus bothers me cus i want 2 w/ him but i wanna wait!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you like another guy though you should probably just say that!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Is it that you don't have one, or your ehaving trouble with the one you have?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And hes not a druggie or nothing like that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just be friendly not fwd i.e.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and he probuble did not awnser your calls cause he was truely bussy
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ask them wen theyre hooked up 2 a lie detectotr
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I like him but..im not in love with him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> go to the gym - workout practice speaking with a lower your voice be confident
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i would just be straight up with your friend.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You can do better, doll !
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell him your baby is in need of him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I feel old too and I'm 20.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't blow it on a thing called sex.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> y cant they just treat us with respect?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he is still talking to her, he is probably cheating on you or very close to it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but once she leaves him karma goes around so it will go back to him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i would say in most cases yes
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Plus, women aren't just ready You need to help...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> don't ask let him say it on his own
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But if I had to choose...Black... White men just don't do it for me..
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No, if you already free him in you're life and find another girl.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well now im pregnant with his kid... how do i tell him without him going BALISTIC!!!???!!!???!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dont drag it out, but make it short and to the point.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Would u like to be called stupid?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I dunno cuz me and my fiance are like that to.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> my guy does he says that it gives him an oppunity to tell be how beautiful i am
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I also like kids...but I'm not one.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It's not just a guy thing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Well, like I wouldn't necessarily just drop my friend like just because we fight.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do you see yourself happy for the rest of your life with this person?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> think why you guys broke up and then you move on too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Go where ur P leads u mayb even in the wrong direction!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I need advice from other ppl.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dump the one you have (Trust me: She'd be shocked!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Then a personality that isn't too bad.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i dont think that girls are bad liars.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well it creeps ME out but some people get intense pleasure from it...go figure
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its only normal to cool off i guess.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You need to ask YOURSELF if you like him!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Doesn't sound like a good mate to me.. but that's just me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you like guys and girls, then you are bi.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he should have the heart not play w/ sum1s heart.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> First, choose only one guy, you love.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But men are people to and have feelings just like us ladies do.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I can't think of ANY reasons.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I wouldn't want my guy having lunch with some other lady on V-day!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> many reasons for marriage break ups, money, kids, infidelity, stress, family
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> also for older kid, try putt putt golf, laser tag, go-karts, that kind of thing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i loved my boyfren of 8 years.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i really mature for my age too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> when you find your gem hopefully he'll want you for you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> She is the boss, and you had an intimate interlude with her -that is that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the problem is, how can i say no and still remain good friends?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you will always wonder if you never tell him the truth
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> make it slow and steady... opss i'm a man...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> straight up tell them and at the right moment.not whn there is a bunch of ppl around
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> good things come to those who wait.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> show her she's important and not your stupid friends
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hmmm well 1st NO its not always bout the outside of a woman!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but hes as clueless as i am.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I have been nothing but nice to her everyday....what should i do?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> WHAT KIND OF FATHER DOES THAT MAKE HIM???
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if she breaks ur heart its not my fault, you shouldn't have listened 2 my advice.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I loved this guy but after he humiliated me in front of 40 ppl, I dunno wat I feel!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Maybe the both of you need time apart.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> an easy way of saying he just wants to be a booty call.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> or just excited about being in love?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he wants to be friends thenso be it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Have u ever wondered why they have to fight?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Because that is all they ever thing about...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> We're not mind readers you know...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sometimes guys say that stuff to play you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> umm..prolly because you're single and couldn't get a date??
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you get tied up in mess your going to come out with mess.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Oh forgot a big one for you ladies.....ever use the sample cosmetics at the mall?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Or, one day, slap him with a kiss!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and depends on if he likes war games or sports or role playing ect...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> all guys do it even when they're married
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I love to dream, about different men, I guess it's okay.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But you'll never catch a woman admitting to it!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you asking this it means that you love your wife.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well... if he doesn't even know who you are it looks really hard... but it is worth trying
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> BRUSH YOUR MOUTH TWICE..THERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE..
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because some guys tottally lose their brain when they are around hot grl like me :)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if not no if your to young like 12 and younger then no.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> what to do is simple know her/his emotions and talk about such emotion things
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ya the moneys is great but there alot of stuff in those places .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it just depends on how it is.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you won't meet anyone too serious unless you got a big dick.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it that true i tryed taking to him but he wont return my calls.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and tell them how sad you are.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> come to romania with me, i already live there:)!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You wake up and one day just know.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they're happy, so it could work for you too!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> believe me, you DO NOT mess with a friend's younger sister.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if all you want is to be with him, stay with him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> lets talk on yahoo shrunkenmann_thegrass  (100% girls only)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she really looks up to u and thinks of you as a friend and probly nothing more
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I wouldn't worry about the embarrasment factor there.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Oh yes, if you realy feel the need to..send him one too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> youhave some work to do there.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> have a serious talk with and tell her that it is childish and you are getting older.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> comunication but are you sure u wanna do that
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Now if you can't say this to his face scream it in the mirror with him not around...Know why?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> as for what to do... dont DO anything.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no only if they are sick
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and if not, you will show him how.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ).....I am looking for virgin girl as I havent sex yet.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yeah your mom is going out with him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he will love you so much more ...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but if you think that this could lead you to a heartbreak then wait and watch what happens!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he must have been a friend at one time.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> The phrase to use is, Hey, I got enuff friends
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> first of all she,s not much of a best friend, keep your eye on her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Try yahoo personals to see if you like some guy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> then tell him that if he's interested, u could go out sometime.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Stare at that for a bit.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe my mother, but that's another story!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you might be too hot for your own good.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> go on a cruise and push her overboard.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dont push her or tell her you love her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but thats not a bad thing if you enjoy it and its with a responsible person.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> beause they dont think with the head on their sholders.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Believe in yourself...it is very SEXY!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I have dated several bi females and its a turn on BIGTIME!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if i really think about it i want to be with both of them i guess.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no, it just like he loves exchanging girlfriends every now and then.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> both  if i have to choose only one then beauty for this moment
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I say.... that whatever your instinct tells you is happening....is happening.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> so i guess a little of both
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> MAKE LOVE WITH A LOVED ONE .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yeah like lumbeeman said, have your bff tell him for you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes he is a MAN that is what we do!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> BUT EVERYTIME I GET BACK ITS THE SAME CRAP OVER AGAIN.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just try to let him know you!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You don't know what real problems are until you get married and have kids!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> that is a lie  if you really  love the person  your relationship  will stay strong  no matter what
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So we always meet and I feel like him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe he's just checkin' if you're alright.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> with love will be full of sweet meanings
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> sure, feel free to chat me up anytime.....
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> your still going to feel you can not trust men.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You can't really expect to give him anything too pricey!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Believe wat u want 2 blive.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well, I WOULD date a girl who was stripper, because I don't matter who she was.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> sense of humor is very important
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he says he respects tht i wanna wait and undetrsatnds!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i thought this boy liked me he used to stare at me all day long.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but if ur ok w/ it, and it should b ok!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just assure her that mom/dad both love her very much even tho mom/dad don't live together anymore.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u will prove to be a great sis!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i guess people want what they can't have.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you can like who ever u like
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You should definately tell her to wait.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell ur partnner and undetstand him well, help ur self to help each other.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Hubby & i got married in July (7-7-01) and went to Hawaii for 2 weeks!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because if you're not, it will be dry sex and will hurt.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> wat do i do with both of them?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Unless you absolutley love it I would say NO!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> There are men who don't care at all about what they look like.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> where do u want it to go?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Maybe its because he is not lonely.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If u have an he still continues to do it then let him go u dont need that!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> how much success you get in your life and you find love is the reason for that success
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> TRY BEING THE WOMEN THEN I AM SURE ULL FIND ONE.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> does anybody know what love is any more.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You urinate from there, and don't even wipe!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Any guy that's not completely desperate won't ask you out again if you dumped him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> we try to make females comfortable.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Or  If I see you with another girl, I'll rip her bloody arms off.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You need to get a job if you asking questions like that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And ask yourself if he is a decent person and is nice.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I have a friend who had the hood of her clitoris pierced very very cool
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So how do i approch a woman and ask her to come home with me and my  b/f?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> THEN YOU KNO WAT TO DO......forgive.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no everything everyone else said is true also.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i dont care if your a virgin  if you are slutty that matters i dont want VD
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell her while in a middle of a conversation to surprise her
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he does that means he really cares for you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> as long as u r true.true love u will find anywhere.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> see if she emails you back or find out in person.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Easier to move on,two wrongs don't make a right.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Tell them that they will never get anywhere in life by being a liar!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dogs r like family(trust me i know.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> only if your heart desires to, if your gut says run then do so
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And of course stop & say hey!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If they are hurting themselves too much to listen tho..find another adult....  a grandparent?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i know a women who was married to a jerk and he beat their kids.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> cos dey have a guilty conscience
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and after the police left the dog was in custidy and the kids were back in bed.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> stop doing this then if she is not willing
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i sure would like to talk to someone
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes, like you are a complete stranger to me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I don't think MOST guys are stupid.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Well, if you are a girl and you like a lesbian, then you ARE a lesbian!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Even if what he is saying is true- why would he text message other girls asking for naked pictures?

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> DONT TELL HIM FIRST, GO TO YOUR MOM OR SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKER AND LET THEM TALK TO YOUR PARENTS.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It's not as Difficult if you know what your doing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if it's love, then he will wait and also not cheat on you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Make them laugh and they'll love u.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Men like this are a waste of scum!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Unless if you like being treated like poop.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i would not like to be the 7th guy if she thinks about the 8th
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> im getting 21 this coming august 10 2006. thats true
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> this is the love most people seek, yet are to lazy to earn it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe because they knew you would be furiouse.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just talk to her and see if she does like you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> LMAO, great way to start the day, LOL
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I gave him a second chance but he didnt take.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if she wants to, she will when shes free.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Lights on and on top is sexy!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> be friend and give him some timen space
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ...you're starting to hate the male/female friends of the one you love.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do something that most people haven't.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i dont believe that love dies so fast.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ok, i think its just nothing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she's still probably living w/ her parents
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> This is a major NO, NO!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ANY WAY SHE IS STILL WITH YOU SO OBVERSLY SHE DOES .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I wouldn't worry about things like that!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sounds like he's playing hard to get...and you aren't.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm not sure even chickens care about it thats what
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You get out what you put in (no pun intended)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> SOAP If you smell better maybe.....
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just move on ... think about how lucky you are to not be with him!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> What can I do to get her to lose weight?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> leave him, he is not worth your time
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> a lot of attention and to be fed some good chocolate.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he gets too possesive send him packing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> when you can hear echother without speaking
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You should try it some time you will not be dissapointed
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i mean.how insensitive of her to do those things infront of you!!duh?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> other than that, go to a party and hit on drunk chicks.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and just ask him, it might be awkward but it will be worth it if he does love you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> SAY I LOVE YOU IF ITS MEANT TO BE IT WILL JUST COME OUT
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it will pay off in the long run.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I am always into the A-Hole guys, Whats my problem?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Would I pack my husband's bags?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> then you don't have a relationship.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> why my ex b/f keeps tryin to make me jealous..
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> my best friend is a guy and we have never tried to be more
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> In my case though, it didn't!

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm not asking him to go out or anything even close to that!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So, #1 - boys say things they don't really mean.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> marrying the lady of my dreams would mean that i have everything i dreamed of.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and really get to know her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'M MARRIED WITH ONE CHILD AND I WANT TO BE SINGLE AGAIN.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> find a new man if you care that much
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You deserve someone that will NOT LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE WITHOUT ASKING YOU FIRST !!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> (at least of course if you are over 18!)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He was like hey baby whats happnin'.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And you already had sex with this man.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well you can apologize,, but you can't have him back,, just accept what you already decided...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> try watching an adult movie together.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> After you ask the gal, y u dont like me.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But YES it could work if you want it to!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It's too late, you missed your chance, and she has moved on now.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you know your in love if u have sex with them
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Because after all i'm in your school.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and stay away from the plants i mentioned.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> People are just plain dumb .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it could never be  boring thing
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'VE BEEN WITH MY HUSBAND SINCE I WAS 19 AND I'M GOING TO BE 26 NEXT MONTH.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Never buy a women lingere unless it is something she wants.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dude same here.. but i don't think its a bad choice...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I asked her to dance and we are now friends.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> either that or u try to find his other self and accept him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If ha can't respect you then he's got to go!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Very truly speaking, wether my friends agree or not, they cannot ever find a friend like me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Instead of telling him -show him what you like...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you do not find her it will just happen.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You do understand they're just using you, don't you?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And since you aren't even sure, then you know it isn't worth it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'd marry your cat just to get in the family!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> before too long..>>>>> YOU SUCKED THEM INTO YOUR BLACKHOLE OF LOVIN!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm right here baby, all you gotta do is ask

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> good luck buddy you will need it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it is not right, and is it legal?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> My sister has dumbed him since then but she is pregnant with his baby.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yeah baby.. a girl knows what a irl wants right???
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He even slept with his best friends wife.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> or do you enjoy hurting those that mean so much to you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it's pretty much up to you to decide you don't want to be miserable anymore.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I wouldnt want or need anyone else.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> something that happened behind your back.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> become a friend to a women first.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he probably won't tell you, but he's most likely to tell sum1 else.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because when you are into a relationship, and if you go out for fun... this kills your partner.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He is a piece of shit and i never want to see him agen.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> She might be able to fake moaning, shaking, thrashing around, etc., but she can't fake that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe you have but u dnt knw it
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just don't go overboard with all your planning!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> we get along great except this issue.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> time to move on to  a differnet place ?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well ask him or ask ur friends that know him and they might know.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Tell him that you are a beautiful vampire ;))
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the coaches were more laid back and i usually played over half the game.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> THAY LEFT US KNOW CHOICE BUT TO PART.i NEVER STOP LOVING HIM.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Start by saying I want to kiss you here (nose) then here (mouth) and here (cheek) Then here (neck)!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Girl, don't TELL him you want to make love to him!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i dont know... are you in love?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> wait, it will be well worth it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i dont think u should give him any more times u dont wanna get hurt again
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He'll find that with another, but YOU want something more, don't you?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> make them want to break up with you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he loves you, he will be heartbroken, but he will get over it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> U shouldn't be with no man who gonna keep pushin u to do things u don't want to.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Some guys that have experience don't know which way is up.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hook up with math geeks, they know how to handle curves :-)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you have to basically overdose to get off.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you have tried to hard!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> What was that about now I am curious too.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> A UPCLASS STRIP BAR WITH LOSTS OF BEER
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes i would, in a heart beat!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> here is not the place to find one
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Yes dude, if you start lifting your a** off that chair!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But that also depends on WHO YOU are??
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes, at least mine do live.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Cauze if you never give it a chance u will never know what would had happen between yall 2.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I have never heard of a guy who didn't like this.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> obviously if he's going through all that trouble to scare you he doesn't want you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> things like this are bad to do thru email
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well, why did you post such a stereotypical, dumb and pointless question?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i just wanna help her open up her eyes before something bad happens....
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Thats not very fair to the guy your seeing now.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they want a man just to be himself, at least I do
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> is it just too weird and geeky!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> wow.... what a situation..... good luck with that!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> is not bad, if you like him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he could be just using you for just sex.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm sorry if you love him (wait you said that you didn't) Anywho, leave him please!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you have ever right to be mad
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But send the ole boy a post card from Bora Bora or something.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Maybe you should tell her and see what response you get.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Why would you care, as long as you got yours...right?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i 100% agree with u there.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> A hard face 2 go wit it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Ive asked her to be my girl friend 2 times already but she never answers.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> got anything better to do the rest of your life than trying to understand them?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ya I care, but its not everything
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hey, i am 12 and just got a girl friend.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just ask him or tell him u luv him n ask him 2 b ur boyfren
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No, this is not bad at all.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because u already know so much about oneanother.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I never talk bad about any person.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> okay youre confusing 1 question at a time.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> cheat on her with a hooker they have experience
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> not  only men have them, women can too
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> #3 - don't use sex as a weapon in your marraige
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> That way you get to sample other women and it's not cheating.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> what happend to his queen kong?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> mabey but ill never find him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do not do it in private.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Who cares wha their gender is.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Shower, wear deodorant & always have fresh breath...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No matter if your in a skirt and heals or a baggy pair of jeans.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dude, go back to lickin yer nuts.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> HE USED TO MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY ABUSE ME.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I have gone out with big guys.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do you have a chicken butt?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you like her ask her out and see where it takes you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell your man, to tell him that u don't like that guy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No guy wants to be just friends with women.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> or what do you think about marriage?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Yet I will not date a large man.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but try to stay out of this till time makes them calm;) Good Luck
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sex and candy Where can I find you?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its better to loose a lover than love a looser
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Well if a guy does that to me, I just move on.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> alright, the way it's always worked for me is to go out with a friend.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> First off, don't do anything you don't want to.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> personally can't even think of going out with someone i gave the boot to bf.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you might even find that you dont like being sexual with a woman at all.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> however I think stupid far excedes dumb.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Because once they are interested then the CHASE is over
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and why would you go with somebody that young or old
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> wellllll some guy's butts are cute.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he is trying to control you - GET OUT!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you truly like this person, then why not give it a try?

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Rather say, Whos on yer mind...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> many men are totally happy just keep sex interesting and exciting and he will never even consider it
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just them down and explain to them they should be understanding , and support u no matter what .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm just his friend, I mean, I LOVE him and as far as i know, he has no idea.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And you have a problem with this?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> step 2: if you don't see any result after 3 weeks.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it is never boring it's actually fulfilling
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> lights off w/ very few candles and on top of the covers
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> oh yes you can.....Where were you that day in sex ed?

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But why would he ignore me??
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I think a guy with a nice round butt is sexy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I have guy friends that are like brothers to me and there's no tension whatsoever.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i here a coat hanger and a vacuum will do the job
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u should have a nice impression on the girl .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> gather all ur girlfrends & have a party.. let her mingle w/new faces..
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ur spellings tell how worried u r.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> or just my guy ego cant handle a girl knowin about it !
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you have money to spend, girls usually love jewelry!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If she like the beach maybe a weekend in the Bahamas.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> this my opinion,that's whow i think about this!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you don't like any of the guys that asked you out then just say no.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it can be very sexy to watch a woman... and yo might get a pointer or two...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do it in person though, set up a dinner date.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u dont take any precaution and u get pragnent
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> HE'S IGNORING U FOR THE SAME REASONS WE IGNORE YOU!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> !LOL WHEN I WENT OUT THERE I NOTICED THAT TOO.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> im 28 years old.im almost handsome.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Tell her to try asking him out or something.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ur question is making ppl able to know that u r single.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Bro's before ho's...Ok, so your girls, the saying still works.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i would not give my life up for a stranger or a friend.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> People dont care anymore about others.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And u tell him it's ur way or no way.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> call and say hello and be done with it one way or another
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> put your nose into her p...!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> She's just not that into you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> like me my luv lives far away from me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> WHAT IN GODS NAME ARE YOU DOING.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't let her play games with you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It cant be love because you dont know anything about her!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it is better and easier to tell over the phone or in person.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you won't find love on the internet
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> u cant put ur life to be all about her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its simple that u should take her out for dating .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> jus t tell them u already have a date sorry about that you should have asked earlier
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> easy 2pts for me and -2pts for u
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Once I just said, Well, if there's nothing better to do .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she might have an underlieing factor that makes her eat this much ?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> step 3: if she is pregnant then end of procedure.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you sneeky bugger..i was just going to ask this question.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Probably the one thing that comes before good health on the human scale of existance!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> WOMEN LIKES TO BE PAMPERED,TAKE HER TO DINNER OR ORDER IN CANDLES, FLOWERS,JUST TREAT HER LIKE A QUEEN.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i think so for romantic love plus its really fun
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> so wht to ddo YOU think!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Not special, not weird...  just your personal choice.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> can u check it out for me plz die fast
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the question is the other way around how do get your guy to back off the girl.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I went to one where they had a belly dancer instead...LAME!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she already knows it not love.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I wouldn't worry about the heroin.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I like to laugh and tell jokes!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> IT CANT BE DONE,IF THEY CARE ABOUT YOU ITS GOING TO HURT NO MATTER HOW YOU SAY IT.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Wat are you good at doing?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> someone else might take the opportunity.........DON'T BE LATE.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If they r not, why would be so mean?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> start cutting him off now -- that way when you get married, he'll be used to it
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just say 'I love you' getting him/her off guard.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he obviouly doesnt accept u for u so how can u stay with him no piont in being miserable.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i believe that they will.why not?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Because once you cross the friendship line it's really hard to go back to that!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i think that boys are more sensitive but girls show it more.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> gave: Get a life... and relax.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> so just go ahead and text!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dont stick with someone who isnt right for you, its just not worth it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dont belive in it at all....its too commercialized!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he is only using you ?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> One might b good n bed, the other a listener!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you got that right .but have to do it any way .or she kill me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> IT WHAT U MAKE OF IT.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> why is he sleeping out with the dog?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do you dream about her at night?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> so, i guess you just have to circulate the places,activities you enjoy, strike up conversation,and see what happens...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No, I don't want to shake your hand either
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> IF YOU TRULY IN LOVE YOU DONT WANT ANYTHING ELSE.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> SWEET HEART I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Pick yourself up, don't let it bother you too much, and just have fun/play the field.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i think she likes me because of the flirting, and person talk that goes on, between us.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> relax, do it and think that's not the best point in your life.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It wouldn't matter how she looks.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Being 8 years old is pure HELL isn't it??
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he will ask you to marry him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> then go ask her out,, :)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Hmmm, a little vague on the informastion giving.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> of course i have plenty of friends who are guys......yet i have plenty of friends that are girls.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> (and i hope things turn out right..)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Seriously, laize faire answer tone from now on...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> As they get  married they syart acting stupid and abusive.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> chances are only once in a blue moon!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> whats the worst thing they can say?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And my guess is that he wants you to have phonsex with him... but maybe you don't?!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> are u implying there is something not good about me???!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> did you just read what you wrote.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And trust me priorities is a big quality to look for!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they dont see them, they feel them
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Especially if u are looking to get married and settle down.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> took my neighbor (who doesn't drive) to the doctors at 7pm last night after work .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> please her in the bed room also.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just tell her that you need a hug every once in a while.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If a guy didn't really care, he wouldn't give a damn.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> (no offense to big butts, but it was a MAN).
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Trust me you can't change them!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it depends u have to ask him first
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No way to know her virginty, Untill you not fucked her  So don't wait do it fast.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Satisfy UR self but be careful USE PROTECTION!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Some men just need a little extra stimulation to ... ahem, get the job done.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I tell my guy that I love him every day.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> what is a gurl to do?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because all men love to compete.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You marry the one you can't live without.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> wanna have girl frnds or boy frnds?????
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and dear as i believe sex is to b done to give satisfaction not to get.. unselfishly.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> adam and eve.... they were smart tho
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> For some guys does it not always matter just about the sex?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> my guess is you dont look the same to her either if you dont inspire her to inpress you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you never know, try flirting with girls...that helps
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> YES, I REALLY THINK THERE'S HOPE.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> new boyfriend, your a girl it should be easy
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe u just need Mr.Just for Me
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the way she reponds will tell you if she right for you or not.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you cant to the time [haveing a baby] then dont do the crime [haveing sex]
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Well, I'd believe what the girl said to you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if ur hot also comment on her hair,outfit,or her shoes.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> once u've talked to her then decide where u are going to live.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Being  a lesbian/gay is not cool.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> sex plus friend does not always equal love to both men and women.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> At least he wants you involved in it!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do they feel like he doesn't have confidence or something
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> gosh...i love my sister to death, but she always seems to put herself in unhealthy relationships.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you dont know... that's why they call it love (confusin aint it)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he even accepted my newborne daughter as his own.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If u wana attract ur husband's attention and #@$#)*)#)_*, then u gotta remember TWO WORDS; FOOD AND SEX.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you watched spider-man the upsidedown kiss catch him off gaurd and just lay it on him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> as thick as you want it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And don't think you won't be getting pleasure from it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it should be elaborate, public, and show her really how much she means to you....  GO FOR IT!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you are attracted to men still then you may be bi.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you have been hanging around with the wrong women.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> NEVER HIDE........... u might just loose them.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you feel shy, just tell him to close his eyes.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> who needs gud looks if he acts like a beast???
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i'd go wit jamookae ,hz gt serious emotional issues!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And you might have already scared her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Let me guess: move to New Zealand?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell him ur boss or just dump him and get anouther man in ur life
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> personality above all...   then fit body (and not neccessarily thin) and kindness...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> We're all a little screwy round here!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Your mom kicked the wrong person out.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So if you havent slept together yet...don't.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> to start having boyfrends 13 but datng like going on dates 16.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> BY THE WAY HE LOOKS AT YOU AND ACT TOWARDS YOU.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> my dad lost about 20 pounds just by playing out side.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> IF these don't WORK OUT, LEAVE things as they were, and START ANEW in a DIFFERENT DIRECTION!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no...why can't a guy talk to another girl without his girlfriend thinking he is cheating?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it means exactly what she says.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Now im at 28 and single.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> far enough to be away from family but close enough so they can visit maybe once a month?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Say hi, then just have casual conversation with him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they need to compete to be the biggest loser on earth

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you are not married and have sex, its bloooody and hurrrty.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> go to a very important (in her life) vacation resort

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Some men just don't function the same.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Of course she yelled about it then.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm telling you, it was LONG.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Tell your lover how special they are to you & why.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if they dodge the question and/or get angry then i would be worried.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> lol I supposed you've tried talking to him?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> a lot of girls like it when you make eye contact.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> remember the good times and forget the bad but it takes time
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well i think you should introduce your self.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Kudos to her for sticking withit even when it upsets her!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it once happened to me man.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Because you're the only ten I see!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> HOW CAN I TELL IF THE MAN IM WITH TRUELY LOVES ME
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its not bad, but it does look kind of funny if the girl is significantly taller
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> NO THEY CANT BECAUSE SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN THERE IS A ATTRACTION,,,,,,,,
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Why in the world would you do something like that and then go around telling it???
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If someone doen't ask you out, does that mean that you are unattractive or something????
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You know what, love finds you so don't rush things out ok?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> My problem is I make girls angry because I'm smarter than them.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and u kno wat  he doin but u don't care cuz u let him tell ya different.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i think it depends on hwo mature the child is.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I say think long and hard about it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> oh, also tell your man why u hated him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i understand that u feel as though shes not as attractive, but shes happy bout the way she feels.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i can fall in love after one month.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Kinda like suicide... normal to think about, but not to do.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> move on and STALK someone else.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I don't want him as a boyfriend anymore.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> so how can I tell him?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Really though, they are just bad news.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I kinda like my guys thick.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just have fun or keep yourself busy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> How to check that I am madly  in love with her ...?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you can do alot of things.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Guys likes my butt and always whistling at my butt.. LUCKY ME, i guess!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Now the devils hell hounds are tracking his every step.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Then see what she says, and you'll have your answer
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> is he ruining his life or what?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Yep, some are WAY OUT THERE.hello.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I guess becuase they are loved, if not they wouldn't find it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it will bring him down and probably not want to have sex with you agian.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> see u ve decided to leav ur wife.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because they are not happy missing somthing from their relationship
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But, still wants to have sex with you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'd never pack my husband's bag!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well if you really love her, this will happen for sure.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> with kids its not so simple.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Most people don't believe in it until they fall, and fall hard.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Its not bad if you laugh at yourself.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Ha ha, have a delightful day.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Ask him if he'd like to go somewhere with you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and me im also mexican but not mixed.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i knew it is hard but is better for you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it just depend on how old you are
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she's not interested, or maybe you came on too strong.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> don't do something u'll regret later!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> sorry I dont know where to find him...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> !And there are alot of other guys on this planet.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no, unless you feel you need to doubt that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> They don't do anything for me....
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It's odd that someone so young is on here answering questions...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> That will cost you 3 points per answer :)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> y do it matter to u?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you want drinks there, make it BYOB.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> See...marriage is not fun and games.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> mayb thier hubbys are not good enough....
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Find out if hes cheating on you?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Have you two been hanging out with your parents?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> A woman wants an honest guy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> 19, almost 20...  how old are you?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its is wet and so cool and better if its forbiden
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you can say it but whether you mean it or not is whats to be questioned...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he wouldn't think twice about NOT using a condom).
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He broke up with you because of what someone else said!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> first of all, are you sure that she really loves you?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> sometimes yah...but you dont know if its real love
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> being good all the time is boring.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> step 1: do it 5 times a day.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Perhaps a little Narcissistic, maybe, but probably not gay...you just like the sight of, well, yourself.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he doesn't, kick his butt.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> U are just jealous of those other people holding hands and making out because you can't get a guy!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> MY GRANDMOTHER TELLS THIS STORY BETTER!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I see him once in a while and I made the right decision.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but forgot to bring some for me .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and why did they not tell you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Unless the chick didn't care if I slept with other hoes.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the more you think about here the more you want here.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ask the girl to go to the dance.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> find a girl that share the same intrest you do
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and that he has a tiny wiener.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i'm sorry dude, but that's disgusting.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> please leave her go on with your life.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'VE HEARD OF FRIENDS THAT START GOING OUT AND FIND OUT THEY WERE EANT TO BE.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> nope customer care took it off of the answers......bummer
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it's a way 2 show u that she doesnt want 2 attract any other guys..
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i don't know...if i were you, i'd ask her whether or not she likes you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just be yourself and like the first guy said, a little money wont hurt anyone.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do u think she should ask d guy??
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes, the butt is an important physical feature on a guy that makes him attractive.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> first kiss send my head spining for a few second.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he says sure hye's not cheating.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Yes, so that I can do the same to her!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> nope.unless they actually SAID we're back on, then nope.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dont make it look like you are attacking her weight she will just shut down and probably eat more.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> thats wrong to the person that said women commit because of money.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> any chance they'd like each other as well?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> be yourself and if they dont like you for that they dont deserve you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> YOUR DAUGHTER COMES FIRST IN ALL ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE NO MATTER WHAT!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Then, he broke up with me after a few days!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> a person is there when u are happy and when u are sad.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do i walk away or stay around????
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> chear up..things will get better,,trust me..
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> May-b you become clingy after sex and it scares men away.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do NOT fall totally in love with him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> wow thats really sad...were do you live???
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you dont mind being her backup then okay.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i wish u da best do watz right even though it might hurt.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Some girls like to please their man so nobody has to.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> U are making issues with him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I think playing hard-to-get is your best bet!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and then again there are the homophpobics.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> )I want respect and I want him to be nice.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> anyone who 'doesn't get it' is brainwashed.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Stopped a kid from J walking / running accrost the street in the rain.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i think its alot  important .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> U need to ask him DIRECTLY, if he wants to spend the rest of his life with u.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hey Be yourself if she dont like you then move on you are still young
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> um o let me think NOOOO.Get real this isnt a chat room
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you will find the one that is for you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sex, u don't have to kiss, but u have to have sex.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> GET RID OF CAT,STEAM CLEAN CARPET,FURNITURE,BED LINEN, SPRAY FOR TICKS&FLEAS
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So look at those girls in the eyes and dont look away
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He believes she would not cheat on him but just hates this and it drives him crazy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it really depends on the situation...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hugging him was probably not the best solution, lol.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And stop letting your hubby be such a slacker!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes u could fall in love after 4 months trust me it happen to me
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> (throws bananna at the screen and scratches head)..lol..Just kidin.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> go and have ur breast treated and get them reduced and look sexy
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if they love each other they will live together
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> (In the future: don't ask such stupid questions.)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> My friend always teases for who I am!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> move on - time is essence
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just ask her if she ever have sex with anyone.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and she dont want other people to say anything.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> once by mistake i had proposed her and she had accepted.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> flirt and find out u never know to u try
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> congratulation to him and his bride, she is lucky :-)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sounds like you not or you would be asking.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> perhaps... but obviously not enough feeling for her to leave his wife.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> All I know is i am with you there!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But I have my own opinions too :P
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sex is serious and dirty, Making love is fun.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Say a prayer to help u guide the best possibilities.. people come and go in ur life.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> love is not rare dont worry and dont be the bit*ch ok?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he says no he's cheating.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I was chatting wit a guy 2 hrs.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> not just honest but honorable........... ie not a cheater or player
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And he broke up with me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell him what you want, basicly, and lead him,
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> be honest with yourself and who you are.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and also the penis story as well.lol
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ur not on jerry springer now
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I know, it's easier said than done.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if u were to fall in love with a girl, would it be her: personality?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do u mean how are u?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> The world is full of fucking guys ...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it's kind of weird for him probably.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If so why can't it make it?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Here's the answer that Life is great!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he is doing it by choice that should be questioned and watched very closely
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I miss him.... if anyone out there know this guy please email me.........
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Ask her if she likes ya
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> DON'T GO TO YOURE BEST FRIENDS HOUSE WHEN HE'S AORUND, OR IF YOU DO MAKE SURE SHE'S AORUND TOO.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you like him then of course you should continue, why wouldn't you?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't spend a lot of money.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and if you are not ready to becoming a mom, start prtecting yourself from getting pregnant...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> start from the day of your wedding.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Forget the text stuff just call him at home.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> One more thing- don't listen to these women.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes you should, give him his walking papers.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Well, if she dumped you because you were just being you then.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> phone sex is like an alternative from doing the real thing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> marry her and go to the court.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just where ever you go give her the best of the best!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> - If your a Woman:  Dress up & act ladylike.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Im pretty or so guys tell me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> they are not good to have around babies they have dieases.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i think u should just write him a note
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> mayhaps you should travel to the uk and find this out.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm married, trust me I know.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No, Because it complicates things a lot.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> idk y r u askin me
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Well, if he makes you happy and you make him happy, then go for what you know!!!

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it's all the inside that matters
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Perhaps she doesn't brag about him to her friends the way she used to.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Okay, so he likes to flirt and he's good looking.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you like him, but you call him a creepy guy?

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Many men are, but all men are not.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You're a threat alright, you just don't know it yet.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i would have to agree with 16
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Of course.I would go.I do not have to be a muslim to attend such a wedding!

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sorry if I'm no help but we can talk about it if you want.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yes you can fall in love after 4 mönths , it could be .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell your friend to tell him that you like him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Since women feel they are mature for their age, why not?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well u cant take the baby back!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING TO STILL HAVE YOUR INNOCENCE DON'T EVER FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he needs an incentive (although YOU should be the incentive, but some men are jerks like that).
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Another girl likes the guy that I do, and I feel like I don't stand a chance.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just like she did to you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Everything, a woman wants everything from a man!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm in Junior High and he is in highschool but he is a junior!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Or, you could always ask him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> a real man would not have to bribe you to kill your child.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and u just wanna be urself.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> when you're both naked and in bed together
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But it has to be up to you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> most of tha time i think about it and say well is it REALY my choice !
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF ABOVE ME?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> How about all the women that cheat.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Wow, alot of my friends' girlfriends ask me this same question.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But I agree that the guy you are asking about was just a dog!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I know it sucks now but you'll get over him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> whatever you do, just make sure you are not caught up in their fights.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Wow, what an ego you have.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Are you kidding me right now?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if u are in luv u will never feel boared....thats TRUE LUV my frind.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I don't want her to die.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just be careful when you do it!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> now, would i put myself in danger for a friend or stranger...?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If i got that same kiss today i'd be very dissapointed.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and neither of us could think of anything better to do!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i want work to be over with today and forever!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> flirt with him/her and tell her you ove her/him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> otherwise its just something else that may lead to love you never know
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do this either before he leaves or when you first see him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> We'd go for walks, & she'd whine.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no,becuase he doesn't really know her if he met her on the internet.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> either he loves you or he doesn't...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He's already got a girlfriend it sounds like.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no its not boring to fall love.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> simply because u only put 90% of ur effort.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Instinctly, I'm going to say yes.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> A nice yard wedding worked for me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I dont think i have a chicken butt.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> then most likely you are stuck in the friend zone if that anymore... sorry.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> wait so he doesnt have a reason to hate you
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But smart peeps aren't a lil too smart.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Hell, the other Saturday morning, I had to pretend to be a shemale like 6 times!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I don't know, I think it is mixed.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> never mind, I tried it doesn't work.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Because if you go down that road and bail on him later, that would truly suck!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you aer under 18 and stell in school you do not want to have sex.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> or shell break it off to make a move.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> give her one in front of everybody and see what she does
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he is getting married to a women right?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe one day they will be conviced.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Know anyone who can make a cake...there you go!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So should I tell my man that I don't like being around him?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> why did you leave home the first time?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no,just leave him like a dog and he'll know how good you are!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I don't like seeing her ribs though, sorry supermodels.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do not know, except that i am not on the list.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> cause most guys are laing dogs
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Women can be friends, but men can't....................
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> when she not asking you for any, any more!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> At least that way I'd get into her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Or like what you did for class....?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> its exciting, especially when you have the butterflies in your stomach!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> 2 months if you want to go in the poor house.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> That said, just because everyone is dating and you aren't doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> LOL is short for LAUGHING OUT LOUD.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the more that you keep giving him the more he is gonna take.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ?i think infatuation is only for months...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> depend on the girl if she likes your buutt she will take care of it
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If I wanted it, I wouldnt only want it once.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> different men like different things...i know guys that like big girls (I also know some that don't).
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Make it look like u want her like something else.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it is all about that dollar!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I`m sure he will be happy.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i mean insider pain, man are not strong they are tough.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Only if she's hotter than me.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't try to ignore or play cool.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it hurts extremaly bad and it is better to wait untill u are marryed and do that
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm 25....are you serious about your age????????
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you are not her type and i believe she is not also your type.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't let him use you ...and by that I mean - Think about your self.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> are they sick or wonderful.plz elaborate and answer me
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because the boys get gelles that you like hin not me
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If u really like her it shouldnt matter at all.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> The ones just out of the blue are TRUELY given FROM the heart!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> there is this girl at my school and shes really nice.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> were not getting any younger, that is the adveture in life.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I've been hanging out with this really hott guy and we are getting closer and closer every day.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> STAND ON A CHAIR OR WALK ON STILTS!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if u like sports play vball or bball or whatever!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> of his life, and he would never cheat on me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> im sorry if i got the point wrong.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Or if you're too shy, get involved in things she likes, even if you hate it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she's realised what shes thrown away, and can see how happy you are.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> start commenting him on his looks!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> The dress, and brides maids dresses might take you a month alone LOL
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe the same way you told us!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you daughter is acting stupid and you should tell her so,  then shut up.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He didn't think about u at all.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No they will not go to heaven.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> all depends on so many factors, such as mood...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm a boy, wanna go out with me?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Good luck and I hope he catches on and asks you out!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Let things go as they are going.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you need to sign another one every day with each other.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and the only reason i did that is because i didnt want to feel lonely.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I have a friend who shops there for that reason!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> (think about what that makes you look like to his friends?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do a good deed every day!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> your damb right you did the right thing!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> haven't done that but i mean..  think i'd either start laughing or get way too distracted
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I wouldn't want my wife to have a sexual affair.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you don't need all girls to like you--just one.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No matter what stand up for your self.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> know a lot of girls here in the philippines that met someone online and got married.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he is joking about liking you, then forget him!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> We have 3 children under 5, so it's not like I can play with him for very long.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> my guy has an awesome butt because he works out.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So looking at other women, flirting with other women isn't cool.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ask from ur sister she give sutiable answer to u
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> The same problem is with me
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Not necessary but it helps a lot!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If your over him it shows.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i think you need to talk to yer cousin.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I think it would be cool.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Women are different, just like men are.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I know a lot of decent guys.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> a girl that has a sluty mind set but isnt one u know
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> probably so couldn't stay away from eachother long!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it kinda depends though when you are older
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you say ur sexy and stylish?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you are living in a fantasy
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Lot thoughts coming while going to bed.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> DOn't marry that girl at all, she is using you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> okay, most of the girls in your campus hate him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> People freaked out about that, but I'm glad I married him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> In my Daddy's world, my Mama was.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dont EVER EVER fall for that garbage.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> There are some great looking young 50 year old men; but why not look for younger men!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> THE GIRL YOU LIKE is going to be alone and she says that sucks.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> THEN.....HE TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF AND MY STUPID BUTT WENT TO SEE HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hook/ kiss up with the guy in front of that girl.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> 1) If you date trash, you'll marry trash.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but this really depends on her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> A girl can be pretty no matter what size she is.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> cos one way or another shes GONNA find out if we got to bed together!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> then if he still wants to be friends only.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she a player all she wants is a boy toy
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Then  you can do whatever you like
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sometimez even a smart gurl could go for a guy who isn't as smart as her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You can't do what you are asking.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Because most of guys are nothing but lying cheating dogs!!!!!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> do you chat in yahoo chat rooms?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> be yourself, be confident, and be honest... if it's not meant to be then so be it
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> that's the best way to find out.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and i say this in the friendliest way that i can.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Falling in love (really in love) is just magical... until reality hits you in the head :-)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> There no better way than tell him frankly, but tendly, sweetly ...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> 30 is pretty young to be gaining a lot of weight.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I'm male, so it must be sex...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> he not into toys or anything freaky.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> When he starts seeing someone else
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> So what should I do for her!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Hi proud2blatina29, It's not just for lovers.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> When your really in love u would do anything and everything 4 that person!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well it depends on if you have feelings for her still.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> DONT PRETEND TO ACT LIKE SOMETHING ELSE!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> nobody will give you a positive responce
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just put it out there casually.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> love is caring for someone, or something that you would not forget.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> A song that's stuck in my head.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Let him know how u truly feel and if he still can't find the time just blow him off.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but its really hard to avoid!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Turn ons: Hairy chest and chin.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if i didnt have kids i would die for the one i love.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> He's such a sweet heart but I tell ya, I've gotta question his thinking skills sometimes..lol.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> when u'll dive in her mind u'll know everything.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he is married you should not even be friends.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if she asks me and I don't know the answer.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Guys like a little (not alot) mystery in a girl.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> without sex, there's one less evidence that two pple like each other.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If it's DURING sex she's NOT a virgin!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the problem is, i dont know if she likes me.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if he loves you, he'd care even it's just a petty things.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> First of all, the guy didn't do it TO you.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> the world is going to end just becuase you ask stupid questions like this one.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> p.s...not criticizing or labelling you at all!

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If it's a chess cake, much better !!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Probably not, but again, I don't think I would want him to.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> get him drunk and take off your clothes!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> to you what can a woman do say or look like in order to be sexy
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> some can't live without it and others can.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it is not a bad thing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN THE WATER!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> doesnt really matter bout his height, its bout how much u guys r in love
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> - If you are a Man:  Act like a real gentleman.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> As far as the love thing i dont know.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it was about 10years ago but they still really love each other.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sometimes it really sucks, but it'll be when its meant to be.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Boys want to become men and men want women.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> which of course really pissed my off.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well first just huge him then look into his eyes and say i love you then say his name.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> YOUR RIGHTS ARE TO DATE AND GO ON!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you are 25 and he's 34, then thats not so bad.

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Perhaps his wife doesn't seduce him the way she used to.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> make her realise that she is too important for u and that u are the man of her dreams
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> try to smile before you look away so you don't make the girl think you think shes ugly :)

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it is ok to like him even though others do not.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> why do men lie so much?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell them you dont want to have sex
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> it is better to 'lets quit'
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You shouldn't second guess what you guys do if both of you are cool with it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> to th extent of giving my soul away...but if its oneside love i wont do anythng!!!

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> either way it's going to be painful.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> don't be dumb and stupid, be average in intelligence.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> rent everything and have one of your family members take pictures and recordings.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Because trust me: later in life you will regret it!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But i think 15 16 is a pretty good age.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> or im just scared or shy!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Think of the &$%# he would get if he was dating a girl in Jr. High.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It might be hard, but try to act like you don't want it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Love isn't bad...you should try it...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Don't just hand it to her.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no, so long as you're both adults.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Ask for her phone number... if she does not give it - then SHE DOES NOT LIKE YOU.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell him that you love him&#92;her in any way.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he doesn't answer directly, or does the smoke and mirrors thing.... U know what u need to do.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> WELL ALL DEPENDS ON HOW LONG YOU BEEN WITH HER .
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If she blows you off, forget it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Well, if he only kind of likes her then he shouldn't get too mad.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You guys need a marriage counsellor or a bigger bed.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> hang-outs clubs, groups....good luck and have fun.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Spend LOTS of time with your girlfriends - hang out  -have fun - let yourself be around other guys.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> did you catch him or did he volunteer the info.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> go out with your mates and have a great time!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But oops.. Now I really love my wife very much.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> ... Oh yeah, a great sense of humor, good-natured and self-confidence.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Holy Grail my friend, Wish I knew.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> is having sex with your boyfriend something normal?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but i've learned that if a guy really likes you, he'll show it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Ok been there done that sweetie.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i have too much to live for.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> where do i go for help?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL HIM THAT YOU HAVE TO RESPECT YOUR BEST FRIEND AND HE SHOULD RESPECT YOU.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> take him to s good bar were you can play darts and pool
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> happy u r. mature and attractive enough.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> No contact whatsoever just a simple crush or do i have to get over it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Either that or just flirt a little bit.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> of course cause i wouldn't be able to live with her death
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Dont hurt her... good luck  just remember there are lots of men out there.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> depends on choice, but i like dog style too much..ok
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> what happens if the relationship does'nt work out?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You two should be boinking like rabbits.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> nah..you girls are just too paranoid in everything
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe d love wasnt really that much when u got married.. u just thought it was!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> then you can do these things together!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Give me your input because I HATE VALENTINE'S DAY.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just be who you are and enjoy whatever it is you like.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no only if you want your friend to watch too
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> we have phone sex everyday, never get tired of it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  but it can make it alot worse!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> treat him just like you would a good friend you have not seen in a long time.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If you are really her friend you won't even consider it!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I almost at the point where i no longer even care to give it a shot.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> nope but if your in love sex is a totaly differant experiance.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> losers dont usualy like other losers.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yea i used to do it all the time
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> That's a very good question....  Not one thing i could thing of...
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you guys dont have sex, then i dont see a problem.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> would you like it if your future husband cheated on you?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Hey guy, I've seen you on a CD, havent I, and I like famous singers!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If he loves her why not?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Sweety, why can't you just ask her out?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Get ideas off of the knot website.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> think about it in my opion dump this fellow?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> other than that, there should be no reason why you shouldn't go out with him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Kick his ass and get rid of him.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Do you really want to marry a guy in a trial for 2 attempted murders???
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> then you will no her if or when your feelings change.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just brief your story and hope i can help u in many ways.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if all he wanted was to make-out with u, he didnt really love u!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i know my ex did me the same way.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> For the long tertm: yes For the short: no
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> yeah it depends on how long you've been chatting.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> no, he should not get married to her at this time.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> My girlfriend is crazy about this butt thing.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> dont be so posesive, let him free, guys likes freedom
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Heck no, I'm a guy, and I wouldn't care if she masturbated infront of me, I would enjoy it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Maybe you are into the bad boys???
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Men dont like women to tell them what they need to do.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Whana come sit in my cock pit!!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i personally think it's kinda weird.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> she cant stop you from seeing your little man.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> even on silent he can see the missed calls.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Run like hell and never look back.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if she's shy than probably she reaallyyy likes you.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> And with protection u can start anytime.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Just keep going till you hit the next Level i.e Level 4
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> one was wolf the other a very large lab
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Some men do and some men don't....
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> actually this sounds weird but try watching both kinds of porn One gay, one straight.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If the guy treats you great, who cares what his butt is like.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I praised my god for got her as my wife.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> U can tell him anytime.He'll probably do that if he isn't gay
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I didn't believe till I saw her eyes.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> maybe shes playinhg hard to get or she really likes u n dousnt admit it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Hey, Honey...do you wanna talk about what's going on?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and why do the girls there have facial hair?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> I guess things can get lost but memories... well is little harder to  get rid of them ;)
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> and definitely consider asking ur older sis again.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Surprise her with it and give her little gifts during the dinner!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Yeah right he knows he dont know me!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> In my sweetie's eyes, I am.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> if you both can wait, then it's worth it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> i used to be like that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You'll never get any peace if you keep him around
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> forget all about him, don't go out of your way to make him think your over him
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> But I hope not, I have enough trouble with gays making googley eyes at me on earth.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It means she probably wouldn't have left you if you would have chilled out back then.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> mabie you married the wrong guy ?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> well, yes, but I hope I never have to.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Woman want it more and the men are saying no.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You don't want to spend the rest of your life wondering what if.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> you can go somewhere else with your bf when you both have time.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> SEX IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS A MAN CAN DO IN LIFE AND IT FEELS GREATTTT
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because if u knew that, u might try to do or be that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> what the hell should i do?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> If ya are waiting for Prince Charming to come and find you.. 2 words.. OLD MAID!
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Keep your boyfriend, but find a LOVER!

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> what was this all about, i'm curious now?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> You know what you want, don't you?
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> It's SIMPLE.... just don't do it.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> nope are u a guy or girl?

<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> :)  Seriously though, the best way is just to tell them.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> just ask if you can't tell.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> tell your parents u love them and move on.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> god doesn't care, love is love.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> boys just want sincere and caring females who can accomodate them in life and nothing else
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> because they feel like they are not needed by there husbands
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> always listen to your gut feeling.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Open it and ask her just like ya did here.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> but i am unsure of that.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> Think, what's her favorite resturaunt...cofee shop...vineard...etc.
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> none of the above,ask me about big boys or small boys,and i will tell you.lol
<TSS_0.97> <STI_0.72> <CPS_0.74> (I don't want to be mean) but it sounds like he may have some cheating issues.
